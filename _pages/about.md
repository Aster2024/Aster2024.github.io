<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am a 3rd-year undergraduate at <strong>Zhiyuan College (Honor, Top 10%), Shanghai Jiao Tong University</strong>.
My academic journey has been enriched by several research experiences.
Most recently, I was a research intern at <strong>National University of Singapore</strong>, collaborating with <a href="https://www.zhaominwu.com/">Dr. Zhaomin Wu</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/">Prof. Bingsheng He</a>.
Before that, I worked as an undergraduate researcher at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, working alongside <a href="https://zhxie.site/">Mr. Zhihui Xie</a>, mentored by <a href="https://shuaili8.github.io/">Prof. Shuai Li</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6-ARmXsAAAAJ">Dr. Tong Yu</a>.
I've also had the privilege of collaborating with <a href="https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~blu/">Prof. Bao-Liang Lu</a> and <a href="https://weilongzheng.github.io/">Prof. Wei-Long Zheng</a>.

Besides research, I've excelled in competitive programming, winning awards in OI, ICPC, CCPC and various other contests. See my <a href="assets/pdf/CV_Jizhou_Guo.pdf">CV</a> for details.

My research interests are primarily focused on Large Language Models and AI for Science. I'm always eager to engage in discussions about these topics, so please feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat!

[Model-Based Differentially Private Knowledge Transfer for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10481)

Zhaomin Wu*, **Jizhou Guo**\*, Junyi Hou, Bingsheng He, Lixin Fan, Qiang Yang

- Proposed **Llamdex**, a novel framework that integrates privacy-preserving, domain-specific models into LLMs.
- Demonstrated significant performance gains in domain-specific tasks, with up to 26% accuracy improvement while maintaining differential privacy guarantees.
- Achieved comparable inference efficiency to base LLMs while enhancing domain-specific capabilities.

[Calibrating Reasoning in Language Models with Internal Consistency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18711)

Zhihui Xie, **Jizhou Guo**, Tong Yu, Shuai Li

- Developed a novel "internal consistency" approach to calibrate reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), resulting in a significant boost in reasoning performance.
- Conducted in-depth analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs through the lens of internal representations.
