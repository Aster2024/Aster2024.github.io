Hi! I am now a 3rd-year undergraduate at <strong>Zhiyuan College (Honor, Top 10%), Shanghai Jiao Tong University</strong>. I am currently an exchange student at <strong>the University of Hong Kong</strong>. Before that, I was an research intern at <strong>National University of Singapore</strong> and worked with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QjehmgkAAAAJ&hl=en"> Dr. Zhaomin Wu </a>, supervised by <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/"> Prof. Bingsheng He </a>. Before that, I was an undergraduate researcher at Shanghai Jiao Tong University working with <a href="https://zhxie.site/"> Mr. Zhihui Xie </a>, mentored by <a href="https://shuaili8.github.io/"> Prof. Shuai Li </a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6-ARmXsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN"> Dr. Tong Yu </a>. Previously, I was also fortunate to work with <a href="https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~blu/"> Prof. Bao-Liang Lu </a> and <a href="https://weilongzheng.github.io/"> Prof. Wei-Long Zheng </a>
